Hello! I'm Atharva. I want to try writing in public. Welcome :) 

I'm not sure exactly sure \*why\* I'm writing in public, or what I want out of it. I'm hoping to figure that out along the way. 

Given that you (somehow) found your way here, I'd love to hear from you.  
Email is probably the best way to reach me: atharva_nihalani@brown.edu. Alternatively, [chat with me here](https://calendar.app.google/K5vdDYEXcTC1EQKw5){:target="_blank"}!
