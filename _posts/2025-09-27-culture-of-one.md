I want to understand complex phenomena, for which it doesn’t seem like we have good words.  
(Specifically, something like ‘civilizational alignment’).  
Pre-paradigmatic stuff.  


——


Background concept – how complex systems evolve.  
They do so through gradual changes.  
Through regularities.  
You have some regularities that evolve in a landscape.  
And you need these to be robustly present, in order to build upon them.  


That’s how cultural knowledge accumulates.  
Without electricity, we wouldn’t have computers.  
Without computers, we wouldn’t have the internet.  
Without the internet, we wouldn’t have [so many things that rely on this vast interconnected network].  
We make progress on the shoulders of giants.  


——


A more concrete cultural example?  
Online communities.  
Lesswrong & the sequences.  
You carve out niches in these memetic landscape, where small populations can quickly ascend / build / iterate upon common knowledge.  
You can diverge very quickly from the ‘general populace’.  
Stuff isn’t *that* many inferential distances away.  
But it takes a LOT of effort to move *the entire population* (or some substantial chunk of it), even a few inferential steps in the direction you want.

“A culture of one”.  
I can’t remember where I heard this phrase.  
(Maybe Duncan)?  
But it’s quite evocative for me.  
The idea of replicating this entire process, but within myself.  


I’ve often been interested in questions that are a little niche / weird.  
(Rather they’ve *felt* that way to me, relative to my environments at that time.)  
(Is this what research taste is?)  


What’s often helped, is chasing communities where these questions are less niche.  
‘Finding my people’.  
(Eg. I read GEB during senior year of high school. Nobody around me seemed interested in GEB-type-stuff, and I was sad. Then I got to college & started hanging around with cs / math / philosophy people, who were ~thinking about similar stuff).  


The annoying thing, though, is I started having new questions.  
These were more targeted / narrow. Ie. more niche.  
So now I had to find my sub-niche of people once more.  


This has happened a few times by now.  
Though there are still people who are ‘speaking my language’, it’s getting increasingly hard to find them.  
So, how about I try and replicate this [knowledge-accretionary-cultural-phenomenon] within myself?  


In other words, I’m trying to figure out how to (time-efficiently) develop a really strong inside-view.

Stuff to keep in mind
- Beware not-jootsing enough + chasing wrong questions.
- Insights come randomly (eg. white chocolate is not chocolate)
- Motivating myself seems a little hard. 
- (How am I going to design myself a reward signal?)
- If this [culture of one] stuff isn’t working, ditch it (or pivot).
- Need to have *very* good epistemic hygiene

Pros
- High ceiling 
- This can be very fast – no communication friction
- This is how you do original work?

Cons
- Little contact with reality => easy to be pursuing dead ends unawares
- Motivational issues
- Not having ‘public contributions’ (ie. rapidly building / iterating on my own culture, instead of contributing to public culture & common knowledge) 
=> counterfactual cost of career-ish capital
