I’m scared of writing.

I’ve been trying to (intending to?) write in public for almost a year now. I get started sometimes. But it doesn’t take long to clam up again. Here are some things I’m afraid of.

Writing often feels fake. It squeezes reality out into a dry, taut line. It forces you to pick a single marching path through the colorful, various jungle of life. Every work of writing is a choice of which story to tell. Clear. Precise. Intentional. You have to cut a diamond to make it sparkle. Mix too many colors, and you get a grey puddle of goop. [Mix too many words](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/whats-the-point-of-words), and you get alphabet soup.

It’s like Baskin Robbins. When you’re trapped at the counter, people are lining up behind you, and the clock is ticking. *Hm the brownie fudgsicle looks good—oh wait, they have the chocolate cookie crunch too? I could go halfsies… but that means I won’t get to try the reese’s pieces peanut butter batter—FUCK*. And you walk out without getting any ice cream at all.[^1]

I’m not just afraid of writing, I’m also scared of *having* written. You know how everyone wants six-pack abs and clear skin, but not everyone wants to do fifty crunches or moisturize? Yeah that’s not me. The number of words on Slate Star Codex feels nauseating. The number of words on the entire internet? So much worse. Adding to this burden feels sacriligious. I weigh upon the world heavier and heavier with each sentence I spit. It’s a horrible feeling, knowing you’re responsible, in part, for this cancerous pile of muck. [Please stop littering](https://samkriss.com/2013/02/15/why-not-to-write-a-confession/).

All this means, the process of writing is a painful, drawn-out experience. I suck at drafting. If you hate the words you’ve written, it’s easy. Every write and re-write is wracked with guilt. You’re clinging to the electrodes; you’re trying to let go, but your hand is grasping too tight, and there’s nothing you can do but wait till the current subsides.

There are many more reasons I’m terrified of writing. If I were to end now, I’d worry about this piece feeling incomplete. But hey, I’m just here for some ice-cream.
